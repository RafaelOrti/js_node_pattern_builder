## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to implement the Builder Pattern in Node.js to create complex objects step by step. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

step. Its main goal is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations of the object.

The Builder Pattern is useful when creating an object requires a series of complex steps or configurations, and when the final object can have different variants or configurations. By separating the object's construction logic into a Builder, the client code can use the Builder to create different representations of the object without worrying about the internal details of its construction.

This pattern consists of the following elements:

1. Product: Represents the complex object being constructed. It can be a class with many properties and methods.

2. Builder: It is an interface or abstract class that defines the steps to build the object. It contains methods to configure each part of the product and a method to get the final product.

3. ConcreteBuilder: Implements the Builder interface or abstract class to provide a specific implementation of each construction step. Each ConcreteBuilder can produce a different type of product.

4. Director: This is optional and provides an interface for constructing the product using a Builder. The Director can define a specific order for the construction steps and simplify the construction process for the client.

5. Client: Uses the Builder to construct the product. It does not need to know the details of the construction; it can use the Director if present or work directly with a ConcreteBuilder.

The typical flow of using the Builder Pattern is as follows:

1. The Client creates an instance of the Builder and passes it to the Director (optional) or uses it directly.

2. The Director (optional) uses the Builder to configure and build the product following a predefined process (if necessary).

3. The Client gets the final product from the Builder once it has been constructed.

4. The Builder Pattern is especially useful when:

The construction process is complex and requires several steps.
The final object can have different representations or configurations.
We want to isolate the client code from the details of object construction.
We want to reuse the same construction logic to create different representations of an object.
